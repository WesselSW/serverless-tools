# serverless-tools
A toolset that simplifies the deployment of serverless projects

# Background
Serverless web architectures have become my preferred model for hosting Web applications.
The only downside is that there's a lot to configure and security can quickly be compromised to "get the thing running".

I needed a single tool that I could use to help with:
[ ] Setting up individual services (S3, Lamda, WebApis etc)
[ ] Compiling and deploying code and pushing updates quickly
[ ] Setting up regional failovers
[ ] Testing or triggering disaster recovery scenarios
[ ] Setting up monitoring dashboards
[ ] Setting up alarms and notifications
[ ] Auditing security configurations and best practises

# Scope
As a first version I'm planning on supporting the following providers and frameworks in v1 as they form part of my own preferred dev stack
1. AWS 
2. .Net Core APIs
3. Static Websites and sites built with vue

Other frameworks and providers could be added in future.

# Motivation
I've been developing software for over 15 years and have never contributed any open source projects.
I'm hoping to develop this project in its entirety on Twitch too! :)
