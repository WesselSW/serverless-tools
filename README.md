# serverless-tools
A toolset that simplifies the deployment of serverless projects

# Background
Serverless web architectures have become my preferred model for hosting Web applications.
The only downside is that there's a lot to configure and security can quickly be compromised to "get the thing running".

I needed a single tool that I could use to help with:
- [ ] Setting up individual services (S3, Lamda, WebApis etc)
- [ ] Compiling and deploying code and pushing updates quickly
- [ ] Setting up regional failovers
- [ ] Testing or triggering disaster recovery scenarios
- [ ] Setting up monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Setting up alarms and notifications
- [ ] Auditing security configurations and best practises

# Scope
As a first version I'm planning on supporting the following providers and frameworks.
1. AWS 
2. .Net Core APIs
3. Static websites built in ASP.net Blazor

Other frameworks and providers could be added in future.

# Motivation
1. I'd like to start contributing more to the open source community, and hope that a tool I personally use may be useful to someone else.
2. I'm hoping to share my journey developing an open source project from start to first release on Twitch! Please drop by and say hi... I'm so lonely... :)
3. I'd like to learn more about Blazor and how fit for purpose it might be for other projects i'm working on.
